            As an instrument for change, BAGEP holds motivational workshops so that children understand that they are the future of the country. By getting youth involved on a grassroots level, participants will be empowered to make a difference in the future. Participants are inspired to become leaders, entrepreneurs, and business owners in their community; to advocate for the equality of men and women in society; and learn that the decisions of each of us affects all of us in one way or another.

            A BAGEP leader gathers youth participants to conduct a neighborhood cleaning day. As part of the greening efforts, BAGEP gives the disposed plastic that is picked up and collected to a local recycling owner who exchanges them for trash cans to put into the neighborhoods. Clean neighborhoods provide a community resource where parks can be created on empty spaces to be used for outdoor ceremonies. Future efforts include implementing a Plant a Tree day to stop the advance of the desert and increase the frequency of rain. 

            Soccer games are organized to provide youth participants with physical recreation as well as learning to work as a team, developing competitive skills, and having fun.
